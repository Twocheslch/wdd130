                <li>I decided on the images and content to use by creating a theme for my website
                    and
                    ensuring that everything in it served to propagate that theme. In this case, it was a Chinese
                    restaurant menu. So, since it was a menu, I would need pictures of food. Since it was Chinese,
                    it
                    would have to be Chinese food. As for finding/creating the images, I asked ChatGPT to create
                    them so
                    that my lead developer would only have to fit in one reference for one source. As for the
                    written
                    content, I looked up a bunch of images of real menus, took inspiration from their descriptions
                    of
                    food, and decided to do something similar for myself, while also incorporating some allergy
                    warnings
                    to really make it feel authentic.</li>
                <li>I communicated with my developer over text message. Given that, in an ideal world, the junior devs
                    would contact the lead dev if they had any questions, then the lead dev would only contact me, a
                    one-on-one communication method seemed fitting. And it did fit well. There were zero communication
                    issues, and we talked freely throughout the whole creation process.</li>
                <li>My developer, Ethan Anderson, absolutely met and exceeded my expectations. My website looks
                    beautiful, thoughtfully crafted, and exactly matches my site plan. I couldn’t be happier with the
                    results.</li>

                    results.</li>
                <li>Next time I hire a team to carry out one of my projects, I’ll have to do a better job vetting the
                    resources I give them. In this project, I gave my developer a logo with a non-transparent, white
                    background. In my site plan, the intention was to have the background be white, so it wouldn’t be an
                    issue. But my lead developer did something else that I actually liked more! Unfortunately, as the
                    background was not transparent, it now stood out against the non-white background. This lack of
                    flexibility was a major mistake on my part.</li>
                <li>Here's a link to my client website: <a href="https://ethanderson33.github.io/wdd130-chesley/"

                <li>I feel like I managed my team well and had good communication. Though this communication was not
                    reflected past the first week of the project, I kept up with my attempts at encouraging my junior
                    developers to get their work done. We decided to use text messages to communicate, which I chose as
                    I thought that it would be easier to reach my junior developers on their mobile phones, which they’d
                    always have with them. Either way, neither of the subpages for my website has been finished, despite
                    my having completed them early.</li>
                <li>The way that I communicated with my client was the exact same way that I communicated with my lead
                    developer: through text message. As explained earlier, given the one-on-one relationship between the
                    lead dev and the client, I figured it would be best to use text messages for quicker response time
                    and ease of use. There were no issues here, though. Lico Mardo, my client, was amazing and always
                    answered my messages and questions within the same day. </li>
                <li>I published my client’s site to GitHub, and, using GitHub’s free web page feature, I published it to
                    the worldwide web with a link that I could share with my client, which I did over text.</li>
                <li>My experience managing said site was good! I had fun learning how to use git clone. And once I had
                    some practice, pushing commits and making changes was very easy.</li>
                <li>Here's a link to my website built as a lead developer: <a
                        href="https://twocheslch.github.io/wdd130-lico-mardos-site/#" target="_blank"
                        class="link">https://twocheslch.github.io/wdd130-lico-mardos-site/#</a></li>

            <h2 class="header">Junior Developer Report:</h2>
            <ul class="answers">
                <li>I communicated with both of my team leads through Microsoft Teams. Luckily, there were little to no
                    issues here.</li>
                <li>During the creation of my pages, I always felt like I had a good sense of what was expected of me,
                    and had good guidance on where and how to build my pages.</li>
                <li>Thanks to these clear directives, I really felt like I was able to make large, meaningful
                    contributions to the website as a whole, and to the webpages I was making myself.</li>
                <li>I did run into one issue with GitHub while creating my subpage for Lettie Waite. The other junior
                    developer had capitalized the first letter of the name of the images folder, as well as all the
                    names of the images within. This created an issue where, if I hosted the website on my computer
                    (which is running Windows), the images would load fine, but wouldn’t when looking at the page on
                    GitHub. Having realized my mistake, I quickly renamed the folder and images. But it still didn’t
                    work! It turns out that I can’t make a commit just to change the capitalization of a file. So,
                    instead, I entirely renamed everything, with the correct capitalization (none) in use. It’s also
                    important to note that, since the lead developer for this site wasn’t responding, there was no index
                    page that I could mess up inadvertently by renaming everything.</li>
                <li>My junior page on Soward’s site: <a

                        href="https://tylercaffrey04.github.io/waite/page1biscuits.html" target="_blank"

            <h2 class="header">General Experience and Reflections</h2>
            <ul class="answers">
                <li>The most challenging part of this project was just starting it. At a glance, this seemed like a huge
                    project, and it was quite daunting. But once I started, I realized that I could get all of my
                    projects done quickly and professionally. The second greates challenge I faced was trying to
                    communicate with people who would not respond. Thankfully, Brother Philips did a great job informing
                    us that we were (mostly) only responsible for our own pages, and as long as we tried our best, we
                    would not be held accountable for someone else not doing their work, so I was never worried.</li>
                <li>What I enjoyed most was either getting to see my page completed (it looks beautiful) or getting to
                    work on other projects that made me think outside of the box. Since you usually have an idea of how
                    you’re going to make a website when you’re making the plan for it, you can make plans that don’t
                    challenge you, and only play to your strengths. Getting to receive plans from someone else really
                    made me think in new ways, and I enjoyed that.</li>
                <li>If I got to do this project again, I would try to just start earlier. Even if I were only working on
                    it for an hour a day, I would have gotten it done without having to resort to crunch time.</li>
                <li>After this project, I feel much more confident to work on real-world projects. I feel that, since I
                    was able to act in every role, I got to experience everything. In this way, I was able to conquer
                    the fear of the unknown, the only fear to exist in every human on the planet. </li>
